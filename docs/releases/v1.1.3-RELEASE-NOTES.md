# Wegweiser v1.1.3 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-03

## Highlights
- **Sidebar answer persistence** per tab: answers remain after closing the side panel until manually cleared.
- **Spaces modal close button sizing**: improved hit target for the Create Space close (X) button.

## Improvements
- Sidebar now restores the latest answer when re-opened on the same tab.
- New regression tests for sidebar answer persistence and Spaces modal close sizing.

## Notes
- Sidebar persistence is stored in `chrome.storage.session` and clears when the browser session ends.
