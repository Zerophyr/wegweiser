# Wegweiser v1.1.2 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-03

## Highlights
- **Provider cards + Enable toggles** in Options. Enable OpenRouter and/or NagaAI independently.
- **Spaces launch stability**: opening Spaces now works reliably while still auto‑collapsing the side panel when enabled.
- **Release automation**: local `npm run release` flow with tests, version bump, packaging, and hardening.

## Improvements
- Provider model loading now respects enable toggles.
- Safer release packaging with clean‑tree checks, ZIP fallbacks, and PEM cleanup for signed builds.
- Additional tests for release tooling and Spaces launch behavior.

## Notes
- Signed CRX is optional. Set `CHROME_PATH` and `CWS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` to enable.
- Upload ZIP is generated at `dist/wegweiser-v1.1.2.zip`.
