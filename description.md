# Wegweiser — AI in Your Chrome Sidebar

Wegweiser is a fast, focused Chrome extension that keeps powerful AI models one click away in your sidebar. It supports both OpenRouter and NagaAI, lets you mix providers in a single model list, and keeps your workflow tidy with Spaces, favorites, and streaming responses.

## What you can do
- **Chat instantly** in the side panel with real‑time streaming, markdown, and source previews.
- **Pick from hundreds of models** across OpenRouter and NagaAI, with provider badges for clarity.
- **Organize work in Spaces**, including thread summaries and archived message handling to control context size.
- **Use image generation** and manage storage with a configurable cache limit.
- **Toggle web search and reasoning** where supported.

## Provider support
- **OpenRouter**: multi‑model access, balance display, web search + reasoning where supported.
- **NagaAI**: multi‑model access, balance display (with optional provisioning key).

Both providers can be enabled at the same time. The model list is combined and labeled so you can choose the exact provider per model.

## Privacy & security
- **API keys are stored locally** in Chrome storage (not synced).
- **Keys are masked by default**, with a visibility toggle.
- **No background tracking** or external telemetry.

## Designed for speed
- Lightweight UI with quick model search
- Keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation
- Clean, minimal interface that stays out of your way

If you want a professional, reliable AI companion that lives in the sidebar and stays focused on your work, Wegweiser is built for that.
